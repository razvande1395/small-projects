Mini game aimed to test the user's knowledge of the U.S States names. 
Requires pandas and turtle to work.
Insert a state's name and, if correct, it'll show on the map at approximately its correct location.
Exit with the "exit" or "Exit" command.
Upon using exit, a .csv file containing the names of the missed states will be created in the same folder as the main file.
